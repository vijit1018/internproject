This calendar project is a **React-based interactive timeline scheduler** that allows users to manage resources and events efficiently. It includes:  

- **Drag-to-select** functionality for adding events across multiple days.  
- **Draggable events** to move them horizontally between dates.  
- **Dynamic resource management**, allowing users to add more resources.  
- **State persistence** using `localStorage`, ensuring data remains after a refresh.  

The project enhances scheduling capabilities with an intuitive UI, making it suitable for resource planning and event management.
